This project is a 2D chess game developed in Python featuring an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. The game follows standard chess rules and provides an interactive user interface. The AI evaluates board positions using custom heuristics, making strategic decisions based on material count, piece positioning, and king safety. The project demonstrates practical application of classical AI in turn-based games.
